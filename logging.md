## When ?

Logs must be submitted by November 27th, 2022 to qualify for scoring.


## What ?

We only accept logs in [spreadsheet form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Frz6BoFUzWNTmiYED5OW_NTWhY-cSMRZQnhvdga4ORE/edit?usp=sharing). Please format your logs exactly as shown in the spreadsheet, or just copy the spreadsheet using `File > Make a Copy`. Cabrillo or ADIF files are not accepted.

Once you're done logging, save your spreadsheet as a commas-separated values file (.csv), with your callsign as the filename (for example, `K7DRQ.csv`).
