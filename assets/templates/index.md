# About

The Repeater Roundabout is a weekend-long event held on many of our local repeaters. The goal is to meet new people and work repeaters you might not usually key up. It's also a great way to get started with ham radio contests for folk who are primarily repeater users. Light up the airwaves and make some noise on the great repeaters in the Western Washington area!

**The Repeater Roundabout will begin on November 11th, 2023 at 00:00, and end on November 12th, 2023 at 23:59, Pacific time.**

Anyone with a ham radio license can participate ! You don't even have to be local; stations may participate over Echolink, Allstar, or IRLP if they are available.
