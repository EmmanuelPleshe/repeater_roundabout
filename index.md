The Puget Sound Repeater Roundabout is a weekend-long event held on many of our local repeaters. The goal is to meet new people and work repeaters you might not usually key up. Light up the airwaves and make some noise on the great repeaters in the Puget Sound area!

**The Puget Sound Repeater Roundabout will begin on November 19th at 00:00, and end on November 20th at 23:59, Pacific time.**

# Rules

1. **Eligibility**. Anyone with a ham radio license can participate! You don't even have to be local; stations may participate over Echolink or Allstar if they are available.
2. **Exchange**. The exchange must include your name, a mention of the "Puget Sound Repeater Roundabout", and a _received_ signal report (such as [RST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-S-T_system) or [CM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_Merit), we aren't picky). This must be how well _your signal_ sounds on the repeater, not how well you hear the repeater!
3. **Repeaters**. Only participating repeaters in the list below are eligible for scoring points in the Repeater Roundabout. Please stick to repeaters on this list, we don't want to upset anyone who did not want to participate in the contest on their repeater.

### Example exchange

This is a minimal contact that you might see on the PSRG's 2m repeater; it includes the required name and signal report. Feel free to chat about anything and everything, though! The goal is to have a conversation.

- **Station 1** : Hello PSRG! This is K7DRQ, looking for a contact on this repeater for the Puget Sound Repeater Roundabout. Is there anyone on frequency?
- **Station 2** : K7DRQ, this is KI7RMU.
- **Station 1** : KI7RMU, this is K7DRQ. Thanks for coming back to me. My name is Quentin! Back to you, KI7RMU -- how's my signal on this repeater?
- **Station 2** : Hi Quentin, I’m Jack. You’re a little in the noise, you’re probably 3 by 5. How do you copy ?
- **Station 1** : Thanks Jack, good copy. Thanks for the contact, and 73! KI7RMU, this is K7DRQ.
- **Station 2** : Sounds good! 73 from KI7RMU.

# Scoring

One point is awarded for each repeater you make a contact on. Multiple contacts on the same repeater do not provide more points.

### Bonus points

**Collect 'em all!** If you make a contact on *all repeaters* with the same callsign (for systems with at least two repeaters), your point score doubles for that system. For example, the PSRG operates a 2m FM repeater (146.960 MHz), a 6m FM repeater (52.87 MHz), and a 70cm DMR repeater (440.775 MHz) repeater. If you log a contact on each, you score six points instead of three.

# Logging

Logs should contain :

- **the date and time** (in Pacific time) of the contact
- **exchange info** (other station’s callsign, name, and their RST report for you)
- **the repeater's callsign**
- **the repeater's output frequency**

As an example :

| Date    | Time  | Callsign | Name | Report  | Repeater | Frequency |
|:--------|:------|:---------|:-----|--------:|:--------:|----------:|
| July 30 | 11:32 | KI7RMU   | Jack |     CM5 | WW7PSR   | 146.960   |
| July 30 | 17:02 | KD7DK    | Doug |      59 | WW7PSR   | 52.87     |
| July 31 | 08:51 | K7RCH    | Rich |     CM4 | W7AW     | 145.130   |
| July 31 | 13:16 | KX2CW    | Joan |     CM2 | WW7SEA   | 444.550   |
| July 31 | 13:16 | KD7WGN   | Lee  |      45 | K7LED    | 224.12    |

You must use [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n13bcPpxoyOSDa0yK9lEQ_deU9bA2bB2_maWWsNqK80/edit?usp=sharing) for logging, to make it easy to calculate your points. To get started, click on `File`, then `Make a copy`.

Send logs to [k7drq@psrg.org](mailto:k7drq@psrg.org) for scoring! After the contest, a leaderboard will be published. Logs must be returned to K7DRQ by November 27th to qualify.
