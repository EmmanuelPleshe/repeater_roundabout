title: Puget Sound Repeater Roundabout
subtitle: Get to know the local repeaters this November.
---

The Puget Sound Repeater Roundabout is a weekend-long event held on many of our local repeaters. The goal is to meet new people and work repeaters you might not usually key up. Light up the airwaves and make some noise on the great repeaters in the Puget Sound area!

**The Puget Sound Repeater Roundabout will begin on November 19th at 00:00, and end on November 20th at 23:59, Pacific time.**

Anyone with a ham radio license can participate! You don't even have to be local; stations may participate over Echolink or Allstar if they are available.


# Exchange

- Your name
- A mention of the "Puget Sound Repeater Roundabout"
- A _received_ signal report (such as [RST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-S-T_system) or [CM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_Merit)). This must be how well _your signal_ sounds on the repeater, not how well you hear the repeater!

This is a minimal contact that you might see on the PSRG's 2m repeater; it includes the required name and signal report. Feel free to chat about anything and everything, though! The goal is to have a conversation.

- **Station 1** : Hello PSRG! This is K7DRQ, looking for a contact on this repeater for the Puget Sound Repeater Roundabout. Is there anyone on frequency?
- **Station 2** : K7DRQ, this is KI7RMU.
- **Station 1** : KI7RMU, this is K7DRQ. Thanks for coming back to me. My name is Quentin! Back to you, KI7RMU -- how's my signal on this repeater?
- **Station 2** : Hi Quentin, I’m Jack. You’re a little in the noise, you’re probably 3 by 5. How do you copy ?
- **Station 1** : Thanks Jack, good copy. Thanks for the contact, and 73! KI7RMU, this is K7DRQ.
- **Station 2** : Sounds good! 73 from KI7RMU.


# Repeaters

Only [participating repeaters in this list](/psrg_repeater_roundabout/repeaters) are eligible for scoring points in the Repeater Roundabout. Please stick to these repeaters; we don't want to upset anyone who did not want to participate in the contest on their repeater.


# Scoring

You score one point for each repeater you make a contact on. Multiple contacts on the same repeater do not provide more points.

**Bonus** : If you make a contact on *all repeaters* with the same callsign (for systems with at least two repeaters), your point score doubles for that system. For example, the PSRG operates a 2m repeater, a 6m repeater, and a 70cm repeater. If you log a contact all three of them, you score six points instead of three.


# What to log 

- **the date and time** (in Pacific time) of the contact
- **exchange info** (other station’s callsign, name, and their RST report for you)
- **the repeater's callsign**
- **the repeater's output frequency**

You must use [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Frz6BoFUzWNTmiYED5OW_NTWhY-cSMRZQnhvdga4ORE/edit?usp=sharing) for logging, to make it easier to calculate your points. To get started, click on `File`, then `Make a copy` or `Download`.

Here's an example log file :
