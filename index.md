# About

The Repeater Roundabout is a weekend-long event held on many of our local repeaters. The goal is to meet new people and work repeaters you might not usually key up. It's also a great way to get started with ham radio contests for folk who are primarily repeater users. Light up the airwaves and make some noise on the great repeaters in the Western Washington area!

**The Repeater Roundabout will be held during one full weekend in November. Watch this space !**

Anyone with a ham radio license can participate ! You don't even have to be local; stations may participate over Echolink, Allstar, or IRLP if they are available.
